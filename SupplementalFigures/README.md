acoustic_flux.png: maps of acoustic flux inferred from Band 3 (3mm) and Band 6 (1.25 mm) intensity fluctuations. Note the correspondence between areas of low acoustic flux and ChAH's in Band 6 (reproduced from Molnar et al., 2021).

ChAH_lifetime.pdf: maps of a ChAH observed at 1.25 mm (top left) and 3 mm (bottom left) on 4/22/2017. Plots of the minimum temperature in the ChAH at each wavelength demonstrates that the low temperatures seen in these regions are long-lived.

CO_absorption.mp4: movie of the line core intensity of the IR spectrum of carbon monoxide, along with other photospheric and chromospheric dignostics. Note the appearance of long-lived, dark features at the boundary of the pore (using data from Stauffer et al., 2022).

CO_epoch.pdf: an epoch analysis of the excess CO density surrounding the pore, showing the features to be long-lived (reproduced from Stauffer et al., 2022).

CO_response.png: response functions for the infrared CO spectrum in several atmospheres inferred from ALMA 1.25 mm brightness temperatures and Mg II k spectra. In ChAH's (middle and bottom rows), the CO lines have sensitivity to the cool chromospheric plasma (reproduced from da Silva Santos et al., 2020). 

cool_loops.png: millimeter formation height in a BIFROST MHD simulation under LTE (left) and non-equilibrium ionization (right) assumptions. Note the cool, electron-dense loops in the right panels representing Case 1 for ChAH formation (reproduced from Mart√≠nez-Sykora et al., 2020).

mm_response.png: response functions for the millimeter continuum in atmospheres inverted from spectroscopic data and Band 6 (1.25) mm brightness temperatures.  Note that the atmospheres with the coolest Band 6 temperatures show mm emission from the temperature minimum rather than the chromosphere, representing Case 3 for ChAH formation (reproduced from Hofmann et al., 2022).
