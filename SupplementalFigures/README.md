CO_absorption.mp4: movie of the line core intensity of the IR spectrum of carbon monoxide, along with other photospheric and chromospheric dignostics. Note the appearance of long-lived, dark features at the boundary of the pore (using data from Stauffer et al., 2022).

CO_epoch.pdf: an epoch analysis of the excess CO density surrounding the pore, showing the features to be long-lived (reproduced from Stauffer et al., 2022).

CO_response.png: response functions for the infrared CO spectrum in several atmospheres inferred from ALMA 1.25 mm brightness temperatures and Mg II k spectra. In ChAH's (middle and bottom rows), the CO lines have sensitivity to the cool chromospheric plasma (reproduced from da Silva Santos et al., 2020). 

cool_loops.png: millimeter formation height in a BIFROST MHD simulation under LTE (left) and non-equilibrium ionization (right) assumptions. Note the cool, electron-dense loops in the right panels representing Case 1 for ChAH formation (reproduced from Mart√≠nez-Sykora et al., 2020).
