CO_absorption.mp4: movie of the line core intensity of the IR spectrum of carbon monoxide, along with other photospheric and chromospheric dignostics. Note the appearance of long-lived, dark features at the boundary of the pore (using data from Stauffer et al., 2022).
CO_epoch.pdf: an epoch analysis of the excess CO density surrounding the pore, showing the features to be long-lived (reproduced from Stauffer et al., 2022).
